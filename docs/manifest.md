# Manifest
Step-by-step implementation process of creating simple. This is the first time that I'm 
calling my logbook a manifest, sounds pretty fancy to me.

To build Simple I decided to use Bitcoin as a model because its protocols could be easily scaled 
down and because of its marketability (its name has  become well-known amongst the general public
- I have no facts to back this up except that my Mom asked me about it the other day).
