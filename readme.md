# Simple
A node of the simple blockchain ü§ë implemented in Python üêç

I built simple as a model of bitcoin. In comparison to the Bitcoin blockchain, Simple is as its 
name suggests, simple. That is not to say that bitcoin has extraneous functionality or that
simple lacks in features, (in fact, it meets all the requirements of a Minimum Viable Blockchain)
rather that the Simple blockchain sacrifcies efficiency and some security for educational 
purposes.

## Installation
1. Clone
2. Pip install

## Features
1. Wallets
2. Secure transactions
3. Mining
