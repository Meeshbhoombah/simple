# Simple
A node of the simple blockchain 🤑 implemented in Golang 🐍

I built simple as a model of bitcoin. In comparison to the Bitcoin blockchain, Simple is as its 
name suggests, simple. That is not to say that bitcoin has extraneous functionality or that
simple lacks in features, (in fact, it meets all the requirements of a Minimum Viable Blockchain)
rather that the Simple blockchain sacrifcies efficiency and some security for educational 
purposes.

## Features
1. Wallets
2. Secure transactions
3. Mining

For a more technical look at the Simple blockchain, read the [Design Rationale](#).
